## Frequently Asked Questions  
### What version of the game do I need?
The latest version of the game on Steam or the EA App. (these auto-update, so don't worry about trying to check for updates!)  
Disc/Retail copies of the game also work just as well, but you'll need to [use the Super Patcher](http://akamai.cdn.ea.com/eadownloads/u/f/sims/sims3/patches/TS3_1.67.2.0240xx_update.exe) to make sure you're on 1.67 first.  
If you know how to find your game version, this should be either 1.67 or 1.69. Both will work. 
### Will this be on macOS?  
For the foreseeable future - no. The Sims 3 shouldn't require any fixes to *run* on macOS, but I definitely understand that you may want the fix mods it comes with.  
Unfortunately, I do not have a Mac to test this with, so for now I'd recommend going to the links for the fixes yourself, and seeing if they're compatible with the macOS version of the game.  
### Does this tool install The Sims 3 game and all DLCs?  
*No.* As The Sims 3 is still legitimately digitally obtainable, I cannot bundle the game nor its purchasable DLCs in this starter tool.  
The Katy Perry Sweet Treats pack is an exception to this rule, as it is *not legitimately digitally obtainable*, and is therefore considered abandonware. This pack can optionally be installed using the tool.  

### Modders & creators:
If you'd like to get involved, please make a pull request, issue or [contact me on ModTheSims](https://modthesims.info/member.php?u=10346421).  
All mods used either:
- Have personal permission from the creators themselves to be used
- Are from creators with TOUs that permit their creations to be redistributed
- Are from other creators, but are installed through their official source using a web browser (and therefore not actually redistributed). This is currently not implemented.
